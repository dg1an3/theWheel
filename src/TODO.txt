*) Get rid of XMLLogging (move XMLLogging.h and UtilMacro.h to OptimizeN???)

*) Get rid of ModelObject 

*) Get rid of GradDescOptimizer and DFPOptimizer in OptimizeN

*) Move Observer.h to theWheelModel (used in Space.h)

*) Move CExtent to theWheelView

*) CMatrixNxM --> used in SpaceStateVector (to perform SVD rotation)
	--> used for hessian in ObjectiveFunction (don't need for tW)
	--> change to vxl_matrix (see if vxl_matrix has SVD routine)

*) CMatrixD --> used for CMolding 
	--> is CMolding used anymore with Plaque?
	--> see if D3DMATRIX can be used instead

*) Move MathUtil.h, VectorD.h, VectorN.h, VectorOps.h to OptimizeN/include

*) Get rid of MTL

*) MTL --> use vxl_vector as base class for CVectorD/N
