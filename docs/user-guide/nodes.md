# Working with Nodes

## What is a Node?

A node represents a concept or piece of information. Each node has:

- **Name** — displayed as the node title
- **Description** — text body shown when the node is expanded
- **Image** — optional image displayed inside the node
- **Links** — weighted connections to other nodes

## Adding a Node

Right-click a parent node in the tree view and choose **New Node**.

## Editing a Node

Double-click a node to open its properties.

## Links and Activation

Links have a **gain** value (0–1) that controls how strongly activation flows between nodes. Higher gain means more activation is transferred.
