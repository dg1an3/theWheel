# theWheel

**theWheel** is a semantic visualization and knowledge organization system built around a spreading activation network. It dynamically displays nodes of information in 3D space, where activation values propagate through weighted links to enable semantic browsing and exploration.

## Features

- **Spreading activation** — activation propagates through weighted links, surfacing related nodes automatically
- **3D visualization** — nodes are displayed in a DirectX 9 rendered space with physics-based animation
- **Hierarchical organization** — nodes support parent/child relationships and named categories
- **Semantic browsing** — click a node to activate it; related nodes rise in prominence

## Quick Start

1. Launch `theWheel.exe`
2. Open a `.spx` file via **File → Open**
3. Click any node to activate it and explore related concepts
4. Press **F1** at any time to open this help
